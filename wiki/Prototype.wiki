#summary Notes on the original Processing application in /prototype.

== Source Files ==
 * code_swarm.pde - Main 
 * Node.pde - abstract entities which move around
 * PersonNode.pde - represents a person
 * FileNode.pde - represents a file
 * FileEvent.pde - a file committed at a certain time by a certain person
 * Edge.pde - connects Nodes and pulls them together
 * ColorAssigner.pde - maps files to colors using regexes
 * ColorBins.pde - stores histogram bar colors

So far only code_swarm.pde has been cleaned (mildly) and commented.

The files I use as input, which contain the commit events, have two formats: _repository_ and _event_. They both are in XML.
 * Repository-formatted files are organized by the directory structure of the repository.
 * Event-formatted files are flat and sorted by time.
Why two formats? I needed to use one for another project.

I want to get permission first before uploading the data files. If it is not allowed, then I will create sample ones.
