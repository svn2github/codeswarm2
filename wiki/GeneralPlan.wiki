#summary A high-level plan for the project.

= Audience =
In order of priority:
 # Desktop systems using the command line. Simple and modular.
 # Inexperienced users who need a GUI. Easy to use.
 # Large projects (like Linux and Wikipedia) needing lots of compute power. Fast and scalable.

= Data Input =
 * A standard XML schema for this project.
  * I suggest we base it around the loadRepEvents() format. - michael.ogawa
 * A collection of simple, stand-alone tools (in Python?) to convert originating data to the standard format.
  * Python would work great for this purpose, I can put together a small tool and you can be the judge if it is heading in the right direction. - cgalvan
 * Do NOT support multiple input formats to the visualizer. Only allow input of the standard format.

== Data Wishlist ==
 * svn
 * cvs
 * git
 * Wikimedia http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
 * bzr

= Visualizer =
 * Use the Processing library for now as an import, but make application independent of the P IDE gradually.
  * This implies using Java.
 * The ONLY program input will be a config file. It will contain:
  * Path to RepEvents file
  * Color assignment rules
  * Whether and where to save frames
 * The config file can be created with a text editor or a GUI front end.
 * Why only a text file as input? This ensures that the color rules will be saved, as well as decouple the GUI from the visualization.
