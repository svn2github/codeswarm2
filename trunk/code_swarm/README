The program will not run out of the box. The hardcoded variable INPUT_FILE needs
to be set to an existing data file.
There are currently no data files in the repository because they are
proprietary.

How to run:
  Download the Processing IDE from http://processing.org.
  Run Processing and open code_swarm.pde.
